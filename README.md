## Parkinson Monitor

This repository contains the files used in my third year project.
"MATLABscript.m" contains the Matlab code used to analyse and quantify tremor in Parkinson's disease patients.
"sensordata.py" is a script that sorts through the binary file generated by the ARCCS sensor.
"Project_Stepper" contains the stepper motor code to simulate Parkison's Disease tremor
